# senior
A programming language, made for roughly the same reason as rockstar was.


## Syntax
NOTE: This language is written in all caps, so don't be alarmed.                       
ANOTHER NOTE: This language ignores "'CAUSE" for reasons of unsimplicity.                                            
ANOTHER NOTE: Commas are always 100% optional and will be removed at end of word (but you can escape them by doing "\\,").
